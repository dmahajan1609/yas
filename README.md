# Installing Yas
You will need node installed in your system in order to run npm
So lets get that out of the way first. Yas!

```
run node -v 
```

If node is not installed go head and install Node. npm is bundled with Node, so lets just make sure npm was installed successfully.  

```
run npm -v
```

Once all the above is successfully installed we need to install the packages necessary to run Yas

```
run npm install 
```
