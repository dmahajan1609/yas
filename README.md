# Synopsis
Yas! is a nodejs based alexa skills kit for a motivational tool to accomplish our life goals. Yas Queen, go out and get it! 

# Using Yas
To wake up Alexa say:

> Alexa, Yas plan 

Alexa will give you several options to get started! Example:

> Alexa, tell me about my goal

# Installing Yas
You will need node installed in your system in order to run npm
So lets get that out of the way first. Yas!

```
run node -v 
```

If node is not installed go head and install Node. npm is bundled with Node, so lets just make sure npm was installed successfully.  

```
run npm -v
```

Once all the above is successfully installed we need to install the packages necessary to run Yas

```
run npm install 
```
